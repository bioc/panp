Title: Presence-Absence Calls from Negative Strand Matching Probesets
Author: Peter Warren
Description: A function to make gene presence/absence calls based 
	on distance from negative strand matching probesets (NSMP) 
	which are derived from Affymetrix annotation. PANP is applied 
	after gene expression values are created, and therefore can be 
	used after any preprocessing method such as MAS5 or GCRMA, or 
	PM-only methods like RMA. NSMP sets have been established for 
	the HGU133A and HGU133-Plus-2.0 chipsets to date.
